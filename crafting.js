Runes:
Bone + Mortar & Pestle = Bone dust
Stardust Herb + Mortar & Pestle = Star dust
Bone dust + Star dust = Pixie Dust
Wood + Oil + Pixie Dust = Small Flame Rune
Water + Gold + Pixie Dust = Small Thunder Rune
Water + Metal + Pixie Dust = Small Frost Rune
Rock + Beer + Pixie Dust = Small Rock Rune
Bone + Poison + Pixie Dust = Small Venom Rune
Livewood Log + Wine + Pixie Dust = Small Masterwork Rune

Any small rune combined with itself = Medium rune of that type
2 Medium runes of the same type = Large rune of that type
3 Medium runes of the same type = Giant rune of that type
2 Large runes = Giant rune of that type

Runes are currently useless I think

Making bigger Potions:
All potions seem to work using the following formula:
2 Minor = Medium
Minor + Medium = Normal
2 Medium = Normal
Medium + Normal = Huge / Large
2 Normal = Huge / Large
1 Augmentor + Minor/Medium = Normal
1 Augmentor + Normal = Large
1 Augmentor + Large = Huge

So for eg 2 Normal healing potions will make a huge however, so will 1 medium and 1 normal. If you're crafting them then create a stack of both and use those for min maxing.
With that in mind I'll not include potions that combine with themselves since it creates a tl;dr post
Stat boost potions do not follow the same rules.
